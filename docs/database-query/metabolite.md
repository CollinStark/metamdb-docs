# Metabolites
Each metabolite page contains various inchis, Mol files, reactions and other additional information. The following tabs are available:
- [Metabolite](/metamdb-docs/database-query/metabolite#metabolite)
- [Identifiers](/metamdb-docs/database-query/metabolite#identifiers)
- [Elements](/metamdb-docs/database-query/metabolite#elements)
- [Reactions](/metamdb-docs/database-query/metabolite#reactions)

## Metabolite
The metabolite tab contains various information, like name, formula, inchis (inchi, inchiShort, inchiKey), as well as Mol files and metabolite images. Both files can be downloaded.

## Identifiers
Identifiers are collected from their respective databases ([:link: BRENDA](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/), [:link: KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/), or [:link: MetaCyc](https://metacyc.org/)) and shown here.

## Elements
The elements tab displays each element and its quantities.

## Reactions
The reactions tab contains a query link to the [:link: Database Query](/metamdb-docs/database-query/search) page, which automatically queries the database for reactions containing said metabolite.
